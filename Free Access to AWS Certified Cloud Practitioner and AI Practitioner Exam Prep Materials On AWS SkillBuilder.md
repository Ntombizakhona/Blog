Free Access to AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and AI Practitioner Exam Prep Materials On AWS SkillBuilder
===========================================================================================================

Until 5 January 2026
--------------------

**Limited Time Only**: AWS is offering free access to Premium, Subscription-Based Exam Preparation materials for the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and AI Practitioner certifications**. This special offer is available on the AWS Skill Builder platform and ends on the 5th of January 2026, well unless they extend it.

AWS Skill Builder, is the **official** digital learning center by Amazon Web Services (in case you didn’t know, but I know you know).

Anyways, this offer includes exclusive content such as:

### 1. Official Practice Exams

These exams simulate the real certification exam environment, giving candidates (_aka you_) a chance to practice with authentic questions and timed conditions.

### 2. SimuLearn

An interactive learning experience that immerses users in hands-on simulations of real-world cloud scenarios, helping them build practical, job-ready cloud skills.

### 3. AWS Escape Room Game-Based Learning

A fun, gamified learning environment where users solve cloud-related challenges in an “escape room” format. This engaging method helps reinforce cloud concepts through problem solving.

### 4. Official Pretests

These pretests offer additional practice opportunities to gauge readiness before taking the certification exams. They provide insight into strengths and areas where more study is needed.

_In addition to these limited-time, free exam prep materials, AWS Skill Builder offers over 1,000 free, self-paced digital courses year-round. These courses cover a wide variety of AWS topics, from foundational cloud knowledge to advanced services, and serve all skill levels: from beginner to expert._

How to Get Started
------------------

To take advantage of these free resources, you can create or log in to your AWS Skill Builder account and navigate to the certification preparation section, but you don’t have to do _that_ much navigation, as you will find the offer floating around on a banner.

This offer is a prime opportunity for anyone preparing for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or AI Practitioner certifications to gain access to premium learning materials at no cost. Don’t miss out!

Once again, this free access is only available until 5 January 2026, unless they extend it of course.

_By taking advantage of these free resources, you can boost your chances of certification success and enhance your overall cloud and AI skills, thanks to the various types of learning._

> Even if you already have the more advanced associate or professional-level AWS certifications, I’d still encourage taking the Cloud Practitioner exam.

> It’s a great way to revisit the fundamentals, refresh your understanding, and ground yourself in the principles that drive every other AWS discipline.
