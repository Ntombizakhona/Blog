# My Blog Posts 
## Continuous Learning, Technology, Cloud & AI 
### Opinionated
Welcome to My Blog.

This is a collection of posts where I write through my own opinions on continuous learning, technology trends, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence: what I’m experimenting with, what I’m skeptical about, and what I think matters long-term.

## What I Write About

### Continuous Learning
I believe learning isn’t a phase of life, it’s the baseline for staying relevant and curious. In tech especially, skills decay fast. I write about:
- building habits that compound (reading, writing, tinkering)
- learning in public without pretending to be an expert
- turning confusion into clarity through projects and notes

### Technology (in general)
Technology is not “the future” it’s the present. I’m interested in practical viewpoints over hype:
- what tools actually help people build and work better
- tradeoffs (complexity vs. speed, stability vs. novelty)
- how trends repeat, just with new packaging

### Cloud Computing
Cloud is where modern systems live. I write about cloud as both a platform and a mindset:
- why cloud architecture shapes how teams build software
- lessons from reliability, scaling, and cost control
- what “cloud-native” really means beyond buzzwords

### Artificial Intelligence
AI is already changing how we write, build, search, and decide. I’m optimistic—but not uncritical. I write about:
- using AI as a multiplier for learning and productivity
- limits: hallucinations, evaluation, bias, and over-automation
- the importance of understanding systems, not just prompts

## Why This Exists
I write to think.

Posts here are not meant to be perfect, final, or universally correct—just honest snapshots of what I believe right now, based on what I’ve seen, built, and learned. If my perspective changes later, that’s the point.

## How to Use This Repo (If Applicable)
- Read posts in chronological order to follow the evolution of my thinking, or
- Jump by topic and treat each post like a standalone note.

## What You Can Expect
- Opinions grounded in real-world constraints (time, cost, maintenance, people)
- Clear language over jargon when possible
- Curiosity over certainty

## Feedback
If something is wrong, unclear, or incomplete, I’d rather know. 
Disagreement is welcome especially when it comes with reasoning or evidence.
