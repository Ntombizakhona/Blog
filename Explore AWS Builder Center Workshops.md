Explore AWS Builder Center Workshops
====================================

Level Up Your 12-Week AWS Workshop Challenge Progress
-----------------------------------------------------

I recently wrote about the [AWS Builder Center](https://medium.com/aws-builder-center-6384c173be64), and one of the best things you can do next is start exploring the recently incorporated **Workshops** section available there, well since some of the Workshops on _workshops.aws_ (where AWS Workshops are located) are outdated, or lead to broken links, I am assuming or rather hoping that the Workshops that they’ve linked on the Builder Center are at least up to date because they link back to _workshops.aws_…

Anyways, these workshops are designed to help you practice AWS hands-on, reinforce key concepts, and build confidence as you learn. If you’re participating in [**Paula Wakabi’s 12 Weeks AWS Workshop Challenge**](https://medium.com/leverage-the-aws-community-to-gain-cloud-skills-0d94fbd9ec40), the Builder Center workshops are a great way to deepen your understanding and make it easier to answer technical questions along the way.

### Alert!

Proceed With Caution & Avoid Bill Shock
---------------------------------------

Most workshops require you to sign in with an **AWS Account**, and depending on the services you spin up, you _might incur charges_. To stay safe:
1. Use the AWS **Free Tier** where possible**!**
2. Set a **Budget** and enable **Billing Alerts!**
3. Always clean up resources after completing a workshop**!**

_The exclamation marks are there because I am actually, literally yelling and screaming._ **I’m Serious!**

### Checklist

> 
> Try answering these questions in your own words before researching the answers, using the additional sources provided.

### [7. Apply for the AWS Community Builders Program](https://builder.aws.com/community/community-builders?trk=6ffe99dd-1084-479c-a4e4-8d5a661903e2)

> About the program
> 
> The AWS Community Builders program offers technical resources, education, and networking opportunities to AWS technical enthusiasts and emerging thought leaders who are passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with the technical community. Interested AWS builders should apply to the program to build relationships with AWS product teams, AWS Heroes, and the AWS community.
> 
> Throughout the program, AWS subject matter experts will provide informative sessions, share insights — including information about the latest services — as well as best practices for creating technical content, increasing reach, and sharing AWS knowledge across online and in-person communities. The program will accept a limited number of members per year. All AWS builders are welcome and encouraged to apply.

**Remember, active hands-on learning accelerates knowledge acquisition and retention so take notes, and try to explain what you did in your own words.**
