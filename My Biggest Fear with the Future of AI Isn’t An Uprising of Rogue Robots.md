My Biggest Fear with the Future of AI Isn’t An Uprising of Rogue Robots
=======================================================================

It’s Much Worse
---------------

**AI won’t replace all humans, but it might empower only a few.**

My biggest fear with generative AI isn’t that it will go rogue, take over the world, or destroy human creativity. No, I’m not worried about the typical sci-fi robot apocalypse.

What I truly fear is far more grounded, and far more likely.

I fear that high-quality AI models will only be accessible to a select few. That the most powerful tools will sit behind expensive paywalls, private cloud infrastructure, and corporate firewalls. And that the rest of us: the everyday creators, small business owners, students, and dreamers…will be priced out of the future.

The Real Divide
---------------

If generative AI becomes the exclusive domain of the wealthy, we’re looking at a world where the rich don’t just get richer, they get exponentially more capable. Imagine the productivity, innovation, and opportunity that comes with having a powerful digital brain working alongside you.

Now imagine that same power becoming simply out of reach for most people.

We’re not just talking about financial inequality anymore we’re talking about _cognitive inequality_. When access to intelligence is determined by income, the future becomes exponentially uneven by design.

You Can’t Build LLMs in Your Garage
-----------------------------------

The idea that everyone can just “train their own AI” is a myth. Building a large language model requires massive amounts of data, compute, and infrastructure. It’s not a weekend project. It’s not even a realistic goal for most startups.

_So what can we do?_

Use What’s Available
--------------------

### While You Still Can

Right now, we live in a brief window of opportunity. Open-source models, accessible APIs, and community-driven innovation still exist. You can build, experiment, and learn for free or at low cost.

But that window may not stay open forever.

So take advantage of the tools available today.

Learn how they work.

Use them in your workflows.

Push their limits.

…_Because tomorrow’s AI might come with a hefty price tag and the skills you build now could be your only ticket into that future._

The Real Threat Isn’t AI Against Humans
---------------------------------------

### It’s Advanced AI Without Regular Humans

We need to talk more about equity in the age of AI. About keeping the playing field open. About democratizing access to intelligence.

Because the real danger isn’t that AI will destroy us.

It’s that it will be used to simply ignore the masses, and empower the elite.

Let’s build a future where AI works with everyone, not just for those who can afford it.

_I hope AI becomes more accessible and more affordable in the future._
