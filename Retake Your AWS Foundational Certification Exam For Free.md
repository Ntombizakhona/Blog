# Retake Your AWS Foundational Certification Exam For Free


## Don’t Be Scared to Fail, Fail As Soon As Possible Actually
----------------------------------------------------------

Five years ago, I earned my first AWS Certification. Wow, time really flies, _damn_. It’s wild looking back at how it all started. Let me walk you through my journey and share some advice that might help you on yours.

How it All Started
------------------

I was deep in the trenches of university life, juggling assignments while building websites on the side. While doing this, I noticed something: some services I loved and relied on were being gobbled up by AWS left, right, and center. Naturally, my curiosity kicked in. I started digging deeper into AWS, and what I discovered was, well… **AWS**ome!

Even while pursuing my degree, AWS kept popping up in my mind like that song you can’t stop humming. I’d steal moments to read about its services, just quick glances at first. Eventually, I decided: after my last uni exam, I would go all in and finally take AWS seriously.

Fast forward to the end of my exams, I kept thinking about AWS. So, while waiting for my results (they were finalized six months later, imagine!), I decided to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

**Two Weeks, One Goal**
-----------------------

It was the First of December: Twenty Twenty. I gave myself a tight deadline, two weeks, to study for the exam. I booked the exam. I primarily focused on one [Whitepaper: An Overview of AWS Services.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/next-steps.html) 14 December 2020: I passed.

Passing that first certification felt like opening the door to endless possibilities. From that moment on, AWS became more than just a curiosity, it became an obsession. I wanted to learn everything about its services, and I haven’t stopped since.

Overcoming Fear of Failure
--------------------------

One thing I’ve noticed is that many people hesitate to take their certification exams because they’re scared of failing. Trust me, I get it. But here’s the thing: curiosity is your best driver. Don’t let fear paralyze you into procrastination. Fear will only hold you back, while curiosity will push you forward.

AWS even makes failure less intimidating. Did you know about the discount code? It allows you to retake your exam for free if you don’t pass the first time. Honestly, I wish I’d known about this when I started. But at least you get to know about, which is supercool.

The beauty of taking an exam (take it now!), even if you fail (fail as fast as possible, fail forward, fail), is that you learn exactly where your weaknesses lie. You can address them and try again, this time with better preparation. And if you pass, AWS sweetens the deal with 50% off your next exam.

### [Failing & Creating a Culture of Learning](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/failing-creating-a-culture-of-learning/)

> When you hear people say “fail forward”, “celebrate failure”, or “fail fast”, what they really mean is, “something went wrong and we learned something meaningful.”
> 
> And, speed matters, “fail fast” is about learning as quickly as possible.
> 
> If something is going to fail, we want it to happen as soon as possible to avoid wasted time and money. With all of these phrases, we are celebrating the fact that we failed and learned and no one got hurt in the process. It was an acceptable series of events because we moved forward and became better as a result.

So Many Resources, So Little Excuses
------------------------------------

When I started, my resources were pretty limited. I mostly relied on a single whitepaper and free tutorials. But now? The landscape has completely changed.

There are so many incredible resources to help you succeed, from interactive courses and gamified learning platforms to in-depth practice exams and expert-led videos. With the right plan, you can prepare for your certification **in 50 days or less, dep**ending on how much time you dedicate daily.

Certifications aren’t just about adding a badge to your LinkedIn profile. They’re about building confidence, acquiring skills, and standing out in a competitive job market. AWS certifications, in particular, are recognized worldwide as a benchmark for cloud expertise.

### [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)

> The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology. This is a good starting point on the AWS Certification journey for individuals with no prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career or for line-of-business employees looking for foundational cloud literacy.

Concluding Remarks
------------------


If you’re considering pursuing an AWS certification, stop procrastinating and take the plunge. Fear of failure is natural, but curiosity and persistence will get you where you want to go.

Start preparing today. Use the resources at your disposal, and remember, even if you stumble, you’re still moving forward. With each attempt, you’ll gain experience, confidence, and skills that will accelerate your career. AWS certifications are worth it — go get yours and unlock your potential!
