# My First Crush, Falling In Love


The Naive Past, Disruptive Present and Inevitable Future
--------------------------------------------------------


I vividly remember the first time I fell in love — or so I thought. I was 12 years old, and no, it wasn’t with a sweet, kind boy. Who am I kidding? My first love wasn’t even human. It was… _autocomplete._

Yes, **_autocomplete._**

The Naive Past
--------------

It all began with my mom’s Nokia 6610i. She handed me the phone one day, frustrated with its predictive text feature.
“I keep typing, and it keeps suggesting. Maybe you can figure it out,” she said, thrusting the device into my hands.

As I started typing her message, the phone would suggest the next letter or word. To her, it was an annoyance. To me, it was _magic_. I was instantly hooked.

I spent hours typing nonsense just to see what it would suggest next. It felt like I was having a conversation with the phone — a quirky, clunky robot friend. I didn’t know how to make it “smarter,” but I figured the more I typed, the more it would learn. That little predictive text feature became my first crush.

Looking back, I realize I wasn’t talking to something smart. It was just spitting back my own words in a new order. But I didn’t care. I loved it. It sparked my imagination about smart robots and what they could become.

If only Nokia had capitalized on that early fascination with emerging technology. _Where are they now, anyway?_

The Disruptive Present
----------------------

Fast forward to the day OpenAI announced ChatGPT, and I went absolutely bonkers. There it was: a chatbot that felt like the culmination of my lifelong dream. Finally, I had access to a “powerful” conversational AI, something I’d been fantasizing about since those Nokia days.

Long before ChatGPT, I had dabbled in AI. When IBM Watson was introduced, I was intrigued, but it wasn’t accessible or affordable for the average person. That’s when I stumbled upon Big Data University (now CognitiveClass.ai).

On that platform, I learned to build basic chatbots, integrating them into my websites. It was exciting at first, but they were limited — nowhere near what I had envisioned. So when ChatGPT came along, it was love at first login.

Today, generative AI has transformed countless industries and is embedded in nearly every app and solution. I can’t get enough of it. Whether it’s assisting with work, automating tasks, or sparking creativity, GenAI has truly disrupted the present — and I couldn’t be happier.

The Inevitable Future
---------------------

While many people are cautious — or downright pessimistic — about AI’s future, I’m filled with hope and excitement. I dream of a world where generative AI merges seamlessly with robotics. Imagine humanoid cyborg companions that can help with chores, run errands, jog alongside you, and answer your questions in real time.

Think of a robot you can dress up, personalize, and interact with — a digital assistant that feels like a true companion. The possibilities are endless.

From autocomplete to GenAI, AI has always felt like my inevitable destiny. I can’t wait to see how it evolves, not just as a tool but as something we integrate into our daily lives.

Fall in Love with Technology
----------------------------

Technology is more than just innovation — it’s a journey of connection, curiosity, and endless possibilities. My love story with AI started with a Nokia phone and predictive text, grew through experiments with chatbots, and now thrives in the age of generative AI.

And the best part? The story is far from over. The future is bright, full of promise, and ready for us to shape it.

So, why not fall in love with technology? After all, it’s always evolving — and so are we.
