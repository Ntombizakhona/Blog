Apparently, I’m Stingy With My Skills…
======================================

Because You Have an Idea, and I Must Build With Zero Dollars and Survive Off Vibes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So you have a brilliant idea. It’s going to change the world. It’s the “Uber for something,” or the next Facebook-meets-Airbnb-with-AI. Great. I’m happy for you.

But here’s the twist: you’re coming to me, the developer, the designer, the strategist, the cloud builder, with exactly zero dollars and a hope that I will build your app from scratch, launch it, maintain it, and scale it…_for free._

In return? “Equity.” “Exposure.” Or worse: “I’ll pay you when we make it big.”

And when I pause? When I hesitate? When I suggest something radical like a budget, a timeline, or even a no-code prototype first? I’m suddenly the bad guy.

But let me tell you what that actually looks like from this side of the table.

Ideas Are Cheap. Execution Isn’t.
---------------------------------

We all have ideas.

Some are genius.

Some are garbage.

Most sit somewhere in between. But turning an idea into a product? That’s where the real work begins – and it’s not free.

1.  Designing the user journey
2.  Writing code that doesn’t break
3.  Deploying it to the cloud
4.  Managing infrastructure
5.  Testing for bugs
6.  Building APIs
7.  Integrating third-party services
8.  Ensuring security
9.  Managing updates, documentation, and customer feedback
10.  The list goes on and on and on

All of that is **_labor_**. And labor costs something even when it’s done with love.

You Want Startup Energy Without Startup Resources
-------------------------------------------------

It’s not that I don’t want to help you. I do. But if your entire business model depends on someone like me working for free while you “validate the market or whatever,” that’s not a partnership. That’s exploitation.

I can’t pay rent in dreams. AWS doesn’t accept _exposure_. My time isn’t infinite. You’re asking someone to invest their entire skill set without investing anything yourself financially, emotionally, or intellectually.

Here’s What You Could Do Instead
--------------------------------

If you truly believe in your idea, and want to attract real collaborators, then:

### 1. Prototype it yourself

Use tools like Figma. Show us you’re willing to do the groundwork.

### 2. Pay people, even a little

Even $100 shows you value someone’s time.

Barter services if you must.

Build trust.

Something.

### 3. Learn the basics

You don’t have to code, but understanding product, cloud, or GenAI basics helps. Your expectations become more realistic.

### 4. Build a team

Don’t dump your entire vision on one person. Designers, marketers, researchers, they all play a part.

### 5. Use GenAI

You say you want to innovate? [Use generative AI](https://medium.com/dont-wait-catch-up-with-genai-20c45585a448) to generate wireframes, brand names, marketing copy, or even early landing pages.

_Start building momentum before asking someone else to sacrifice theirs._

Concluding Remarks
------------------

I want to collaborate. I want to build cool things. But I won’t survive off “_ideas, exposure and vision_.” My skills weren’t handed to me. They were built over years, with late nights, trial and error, and sometimes pure willpower. They are valuable to me.

So if you have a great idea, awesome. Pitch it. But come with more than just an idea.

**Come with humility. Come with respect. Come with something that shows you’re in this for real.**
