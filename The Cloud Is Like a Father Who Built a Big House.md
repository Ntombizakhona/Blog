The Cloud Is Like a Father Who Built a Big House
================================================

And You’re Already Living in It
-------------------------------

_If you want to get a feel for what cloud computing – particularly AWS, the pioneer – is like, then let me tell you a story._

### Imagine this:

Your father is an independent contractor. A brilliant entrepreneur with the mind of an engineer. Years ago, he built a massive, well-designed house for you and your family. A house with everything you could ever need – space, running water, lights that never go out, rooms that can turn into whatever you need them to be: a studio, an office, a server room, a cinema.

### The best part?

Some parts of the house are free to use. Others, you only pay for what you consume – like electricity or water – because maybe you and your sister don’t use them the same way. It’s efficient, flexible, and made with love.

But like many of us do when we grow older, you become a teenager and decide it’s time to move out.

You want your own space. Your own rules. Your own identity.

So, you rent an unnecessarily expensive apartment in the city. You’re finally independent… but you quickly realize: you can’t afford it.

### You call your dad for help.

But instead of bailing you out, he says,

**“I’ll give you anything you want – as long as you come home.”**

Frustrated, you hustle.

You juggle jobs.

You chase stability.

But then, something odd happens. One day, while reviewing your rent bill, you notice a tiny line under the landlord’s information:

> Property managed by: Dad’s Real Estate Company

_Wait – what?_

Turns out, your landlord is renting the property from your dad, and just charging you a premium on top.

### So you move out again.

You hear about a new eco-friendly estate being built across town. Solar panels, gas alternatives, backup water tanks – the whole modern package. You rush to apply.

You want to be the first to live there.

And then you see it again:

> Powered by: Dad’s Construction Firm

_Once again – he’s the one building the future. Literally._

Defeated but curious, you look into shelters and non-profits. Surely, surely, this is a world untouched by your father’s reach. But nope.

He’s there too.

He funds and maintains the infrastructure.

He even donates resources, quietly and generously.

Eventually, you give in.

### You go back home.

And the moment you step through the door, he smiles and says:

“Oh, hi. My prodigal child.”

“You’re in every industry, Dad!”

“Yes,” he says. “And most importantly – I didn’t build this big house for it to sit empty. You might as well use it.”

And so you do.

This time, with new appreciation.

You see how everything just works. He handles the plumbing, the wiring, the upgrades. When the neighbor sets up a nice screen, your dad casually brings home a massive one – with more powerful GPUs and higher resolution!

_Thanks Dad._

He even asks for your input:

“What do you want to build next?”

You’re no longer just a tenant. You’re a co-creator.

**_That’s AWS._**

You might think you’re not using the cloud. But chances are – you are.

When you watch Netflix, stream Spotify, use Duolingo, play online games, transfer money, or use ChatGPT – you’re tapping into that house your father built.

So instead of renting overpriced tools from someone else who’s just leasing them from AWS anyway —

Why not just move in and build directly on the cloud?

### Because here’s the truth:

AWS – and cloud computing in general – isn’t some distant, complex tech jungle.

_It’s a home._

**Built for you.**

Ready for you to grow, experiment, fail, succeed – and thrive.

_So come home._

**The cloud is waiting.**

And the possibilities are endless…
